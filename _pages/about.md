## Introduction to Python Programming

**Hi!** This is *Ka Hei*. This space is created at the *end of 2021* for introducing users in the humanities to pick up some `basic programming skills`📍 for research using `digital text resources`. You do not need to have any programming knowledge when you start with the tutorials. It covers tasks from `data acquisition`, `analysis` to `visualization`, working with both `text`📜 and `geospatial data`🗺️. All tutorials use ***(historical) Chinese text*** to demonstrate workflows of relevant tasks (sometimes mixed with examples from other languages, ***eg. Japanese, Korean, and English***).

<br>

## Instructions

#### WHY this space?

🔎 Instead of introducing users to diverse tools (Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jekyll, R etc.), it only focus on ONE: **PYTHON**, which can be used to approach a wide range of tasks (without knowledge of other tools)

🔎 All tutorials can be run in the **Colab** cloud environment so **NO ENVIRONMENT SET UP AND INSTALLATION** in the local device needed. It also **MINIMIZE UNINSTRUCTED STEPS** (eg. downloading and preprocessing files on your own) so that everyone can follow along.

🔎 Instead of being application-oriented (Network analysis, Geocode data, supervised classification, etc.), it starts from the basics and slowly introduce users different analysis concepts in a **SYSTEMATIC** manner

🔎 It focuses on applications in **CHINESE** language and history to give users in this discipline more concrete instructions

<br>

#### This is the RIGHT space for you if:

⭐ You are **NEW TO PROGRAMMING** and do not know **WHERE TO START**

⭐ You want to pick up **ONE TOOL FIRST** for digital humanity which can handle **MOST** of the task

⭐ You find it difficult to follow existing tutorials and want to **DO IT BIT BY BIT FROM THE SCRATCH**

⭐ You are **STUCK** with downloading and installing digital tools

⭐ You want to learn a tool that **DO NOT NEED A LICENSE** and is **ALWAYS FREELY AVAILABLE**

⭐ You want to have a **BIG PICTURE** what can you **ACHIEVE** with the digital tools

<br>

#### This is NOT the RIGHT space for you if:

🤔 You **MASTER PROGRAMMING** already and wish to harness the potential of multiple programming languages

🤔 You do **NOT** appreciate **FREE OPEN SOURCE TOOLS**

🤔 You prefer a **VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE** 

🤔 You are **NOT PREPARED** for consistent learning for the **NEXT MONTHS**

<br>

#### Summary of the tutorials:

🕹️ Introduction to Python Programming

🕹️ Plotting and Interactive Data Visualization

🕹️ Data Manipulation using Pandas

🕹️ Web Scrapping and Text Analysis

🕹️ Working with Geospatial Data

<br>

#### Python Libraries covered:

beautifulsoup4, Bokeh, geopandas, matplotlib, folium, matplotlib, networkx, numpy, pandas, seaborn, urllib2, requests, re, SnowNLP, SpaCy, jieba


<br>

#### You will be ABLE to:

👍 Write simple **PYTHON CODE** that fit your purposes (*Oh what is your purposes?* 😃)

👍 Create some **INTERACTIVE** contents/ graphics to present results

👍 Have your first **WEBMAP**!

👍 Know how to dive into **DIGITAL DATABASE** yourself without browsing around

<br>

#### You will NOT be ABLE to:

🙅‍♀️ Know how to make a dynamic and highly interactive website yourself just by following the tutorials

🙅‍♀️ Know how to start with a project yourself if you only read the code, but not practice

🙅‍♀️ Debug all the potential problems just by following the tutorials, use *GOOGLE* and *stackoverflow*!

🙅‍♀️ FLY!! 🐤

<br>

#### How to use this Space 🚀:

* **ALL** the tutorials provided here is ordered **by LEVELS (lv1: the easiest, lv4: the most difficult)** and it is recommanded to **FOLLOW THE ORDER** when you go through them

* There are **PREREQUISITES** for almost all of the tutorials so please **FOLLOW the links** before you start with the content

* There are **REFERENCES** in all the introduced concepts so feel free to read external resources before you continue

* The tutorials do **NOT COVER** all possibilities or functionalities of the *Python libraries* so please do not solely depends on them

* **PRACTICE** is the only way to go! So please download the notebooks and play around by yourselves. **TYPE THE CODE** by yourselves and **TRY** to change some options and run them again.

* Inputs and potential outputs from the tutorials are available in the ***data*** folder.

* Additional notebooks for references only are available in the ***additional*** folder.

* The notebooks are developed in the **Colab environment** so it is the most straight-forward if you run them in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) too.

* If you find some issues of the code itself or have some suggestions on the topics, please feel free to **FILE ISSUES** on GitHub.

<br>

#### Please pay attention 💡:

* 👷 indicates that the folder is currently under construction.

* Copy the link to https://nbviewer.org/ for viewing if notebooks cannot be loaded.

* This space is set up volunarily with limited time so please be understanding of the typo and writing mistakes not yet corrected.

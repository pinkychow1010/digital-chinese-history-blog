Hi! This site focuses on Python and aims to support users to conduct academic research in the humanities using open source programming languages. 
This is created at the end of 2021 by [Ka Hei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ka-hei-chow-231345188/) who is a Hongkonger passionated about machine learning and data science.

No programming knowledge is required to start with the tutorials. It covers tasks from data acquisition, analysis to visualization, working with both textüìú and geospatial dataüó∫Ô∏è. 
All tutorials use (historical) Chinese text to demonstrate workflows of relevant tasks.

Before start, please read the [instructions](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/digital-chinese-history-blog/about/).

<h3>Chapter 1: Python Programming Basics</h3>

Are you wondering how to start with Python? The following tutorials prepared you with the basics required for further data analysis and visualization.

<h3>Chapter 3: Data Visualization</h3>

This chapter covers Bokeh and Plotly, which allow you to create some interactive figures for presentation.

(Coming soon ...)

<h3>Chapter 4: Text Analysis</h3>

Are you wondering what is NLP and how can you apply them to the digital Chinese texts? Here you will learn some simple concepts and implementations in Python using spaCy, pytesseract, jieba and BeautifulSoup4.

(Coming soon ...)

<h3>Chapter 5: Network Analysis</h3>

Here some basic concepts for network analysis are covered using NetworkX and Plotly. 

(Coming soon ...)

<h3>Chapter 6: Geospatial Map</h3>

In chapter 6, we begin to work with spatial data which is essential for creating map. Apart from GIS, geospatial analysis and visualization can also be performed in Python. Libraries geopandas and folium are covered.

(Coming soon ...)

<h3>Chapter 7: Web-based Tools</h3>

In order to share your interactive presentation, a web application can be useful. Here Github Pages and dash is covered to show the workflow for creating a simple webmap.

(Coming soon ...)

Some of the practices are more relevant for professional programmers, but here we mention the more relevant one for users who mostly code for fixed-term research projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Documentation is important. Although you might be really sure what you are doing when you code, most of the time it is not anymore the case when you wake up another morning, after busy time working on other projects or after a nice family trip. Do not need to mentioned if you are looking at your own code from last year. Do always document them, either by writing a comment with `#`, `\"\"\" \"\"\"`, or use a `Jupyter Notebook` and add more texts!\n",
    "\n",
    "And sometimes you might have a project together with your colleagues, and they also need to understand what you are doing. Or if you are always working alone, then one day you colleagues want to get some insights from the code you wrote. You are not gonna show them and explain everything to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "So make use of comments! When we write comments, we do not write what is done, we write **what is the purpose**. For example, if you create a new dataframe with two columns from the old dataframe, it is better to write **\"extract coordinates and name from historical sites\"** than **\"create new dataframe\"**, bacause the later comment do not give enough context and new information to the readers."

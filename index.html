No programming knowledge is required to start with the tutorials. It covers tasks from data acquisition, analysis to visualization, working with both textüìú and geospatial dataüó∫Ô∏è. 
All tutorials use (historical) Chinese text to demonstrate workflows of relevant tasks.

Before start, please read the [instructions](https://pinkychow1010.github.io/digital-chinese-history-blog/jupyter/2020/01/31/Python_Research_Q&A_Basics.html).

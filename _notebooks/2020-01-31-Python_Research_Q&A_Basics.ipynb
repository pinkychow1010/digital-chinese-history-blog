    "**Python** is getting more and more popular, not only in the field of computer science, but also in the diverse fields when it comes to computation, working with digital resources and data presentation. This notebook aims to give users some basic knowledge about the potential of Python programming language in the context of humanity research.\n",

    "Although Python is a programming language, it is different from other low-level programming languages by being more **user-friendly** and more close to a interpreter than machine code. It is for general purpose and also relatively **beginner-friendly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not only more **readable**, it also has **less structural rules** and usually much **shorter**. Compared to other languages such as JavaScript, Python has not so much low-level language like syntax so its learning curve is not as steep."

    "Although Python is a programming language and is often associated with computing and numbers, it can help you with qualitative research too!

And you want to get the text file of certain chapters. What you can do is to use Python to scrap the text and load it in a file for you.

    "\n",
    "Let's say now you got your results already, and you need to present them either in a paper, in a PowerPoint or make a simple webpage that you can shared with your colleagues or your audience. You can also make both static and **interactive charts/ text visualization** using Python. They can be either a bar chart for comparison, a word cloud for showing key words, or a map showing geolocations of objects.\n",

Meanwhile, you might want to output your research in a digital format. \n",

Sometimes you might download historical data in Stata Data File Format (.dta), other times what you have is a large CSV file. When you try to do a specific task, you might search for online tools which often is not free or is not convenient (For example, you might need to process the file one by one). Learning Python enable you to gain **multiple skills** working with different data formats, including but not limited to **txt**, **XML**, **csv**, **xlsx**, **json**, **geojson**, **shp**, **pdf**, and **dta**. Reading those format is the first step of everything coming after, such as cleaning them or filtering them.\n",

The difference is that you have way more controls on the layouts and types of visualization.\n",

It is why having a large community make it easier to get the job done."

Depending on the website and the nature of the data, the download format will also change (.mdb, csv, etc.). Sometimes the data you are looking for is not systematically stored, which might also require some **web scraping**, such as grabbing tables on a webpage (In this case you can use **beautifulsoup** or **selenium**). No matter how and in what format your data is stored, you can always access them using Python.\n",

        "Data access does not simply mean copying the resources, but also having them in a structural framework so you can use them effectively. By reading the data in a structured way, you can clean the irrelevant information, filter items that fit your interests without any manual effort. For example, you can clean all the empty rows, or convert your table from long to wide format. Python is even more advantageous when you work with **time series** or **spatial data** owing to its powerful libraries **Pandas** and **Geopandas**. With the geospatial libraries, you can easily perform geospatial operations and **make maps** just like in geographic information system (GIS). "

Although big data offers us more material to conduct research, often it is not realistic for us to work with a large amount of data, for instance, thousands of novels/ publications. We might solely want to filter very little information from the data pool or have an overview of all materials. We can achieve it by performing **topic modelling**, counting the frequency of keywords, or computing statistics. \n",

The mentioned approaches require different skills in **text mining**, **big data analysis**, and **NLP**. With Python, we can smoothly combine multiple domains in a single script. Learning a new tool always takes time. Hence, the best is to select tools that can reasonably perform most tasks. With the aid of Python, you can easily save time for the redundant tasks."

By aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data, we can observe the patterns of texts in a large scale, for example, some formal aspects of literature. It aims to have a more abstract view of the texts by visualizing their global features. One of the technique is **Term Frequency(TF) — Inverse Dense Frequency(IDF)** used to classify text resources. Other techniques include **sentiment analysis** and **text similarity metrics**. It can also be combined with different elements such as **geospatial maps** to visualize geographical information.

It is a pain when you realize an online tool is a bit deviated from what you expected, as there is often no way to further customize it. For instance, when you try to create a **word cloud** online, but am not satistified with the color use, the font, or simply that they do not support the language you use.

Both of the languages share many tools, for example, **spacyr** provides a convenient R wrapper around the **Python spaCy** for distant reading and **plotnine** is a Python implementation of **R ggplot**. Many useful libraries also support both languages, for example, **Plotly** for interactive plotting and **Jieba** for Chinese NLP.
